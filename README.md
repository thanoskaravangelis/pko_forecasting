# Palm Kernel Oil Price Forecasting

## Overview

In this hands-on project, we  explore the exciting world of predictive analytics by building a forecasting model for palm kernel oil prices. Throughout this project, we delve into data analysis, time series forecasting, and machine learning.

## Project Description

### Objective

The main objective of this workshop is to develop a robust forecasting model that can predict future palm kernel oil prices based on historical data and external factors. We preprocess and analyze time series data, select appropriate forecasting algorithms, and evaluate the performance of the models.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Gain insights into the historical trends and patterns of palm kernel oil prices through exploratory data analysis.
  
- **Preprocessing:** Cleanse and prepare the data for modeling, handling missing values, and addressing outliers.
  
- **Model Development:** Implement various time series forecasting techniques such as machine learning algorithms like LSTM and XGBoost.

- **Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy of your models using appropriate evaluation metrics, ensuring the reliability of your predictions.

- **Visualization:** Create informative visualizations to communicate the forecasted trends effectively.
